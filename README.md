# Employee Tracker

## Description
Welcome to the employee tracker! It’s tough keeping track of all your departments, titles, employees, their ID’s, salaries, titles, etc. I’ve created a program that allows you to not only view all departments, titles and their associated salaries, but also view all of your employees's names, ids, role ids, and whether they're a manager or not.

Additionally, you’re able to add new employees, including their first/last name, role id, and manager id, along with updating current employees’ roles. You're even able to add in new departments, roles (the title and salary that comes with those roles), and new employees.
